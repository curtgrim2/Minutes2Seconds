# Minutes2Seconds

**Inspiration:** When attempting to create a quiz on the uwufufu website, in order to start a youtube video at a specific time, you must input the time in seconds. The issue is that Youtube videos are formatted by HH:MM:SS (Hours:Minutes:Seconds). So I spontaneously created this program, as I expect the website to eventually do the same themselves.
